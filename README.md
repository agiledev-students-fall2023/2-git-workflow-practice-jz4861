This article is the investigation report of a series of appalling medical incidents caused by flaws in the program which controls a linear accelerator for curing cancers. It's very long and boring and uncomfortable to read, but it does remind people how much damage can be done by a poorly wrote computer program.

Kevin Huang (ch3936): This article definitely makes us rethink about the risk of trusting our lives to a program that might be written with flaws. What happened to the patient is truly a tragedy, and we should have stricter regulations over machines that are used in the safety-critical systems.
